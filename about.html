    <p>
        My name is Ryan Fang, and I am a dedicated young developer with a growing passion
        for technology and software creation. This website serves as a space for me to
        showcase my projects, experiment with new ideas, and continue developing my skills
        in web development and programming. I enjoy building clean, functional tools—like
        this weather app—and I’m always exploring new ways to improve and expand my work.
        Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more projects as I continue
        learning and growing as a developer.
